The goal of this project is to build a system capable of evaluating and simulating the most efficient route for delivering packages logistically.  The intent of the project is to be used by WGUPS for their Daily Local Deliveries (DLD) because of inconsistency in delivering packages by the desired time.  An algorithm was selected and implemented to meet the given requirements.  Data was provided in the assignment that contained a list of packages each with a list of properties, destinations, and the associated distances between all provided locations.  A greedy algorithm was implemented due to its balance of effectiveness and ease of implementation.  This document will provide a thorough overview of the implementation.
